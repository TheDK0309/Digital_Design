Debug method: ModelSim Flow
Problem: While running debug mode on "broken_paddle" component in Modelsim, we can observe that the x_coord output stops shifting ('11') to the right when its value is x03 (i.e. b00000011) even though btn(3) was high, which is what it was supposed to. However, after that btn signal switched to x1 (btn(0) high -> left shifting), x_coord signal remained unchanged.
Fix: At the AND gate "and_l_to_merge", the Active-Low input should be x_coord(7) instead of x_coord(0)
